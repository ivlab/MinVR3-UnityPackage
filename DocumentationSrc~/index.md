This is the 3rd incarnation of "MinVR", a VR (really XR) open source toolkit designed to support research in XR, spatial user interfaces, pen and touch interfaces, and 3D data visualization.  MinVR3 has been developed by the University of Minnesota's [Interactive Visualization Lab](https://ivlab.cs.umn.edu/), building upon collaborations in past MinVRs with Brown University and Macalester College.
