# Cluster Mode

Cluster mode provides support for tiled displays powered by a cluster of graphics computers.  Key features are:
- Frame-level dual or quad-buffered rendering synchronization (i.e., swap lock)
- Frame-level event synchronization (i.e., VREvents are synchronized across all nodes each frame, and any node can act as the original event generator).
