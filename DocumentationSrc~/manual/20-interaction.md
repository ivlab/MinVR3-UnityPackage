# Interaction Techniques

  This work will grow into its own project.  (Tentative Title:  *Open Up: A Library of Spatial Interaction Techniques*.)  However, it is so closely tied to the way MinVR works and so useful to consider while developing MinVR, that we will begin by working on them together in the same repository.  The scripts inside MinVR3's `interaction` folder are like the incubator for OpenUp.
