# Remote Connections

MinVR apps can communicate with remote applications or services by sending VREvents across the network.  This can be done in two different modes.  Remote Connections (described on this page) are for situations where the goal is to pass messages or data.  VREvents are also shared across the network when running MinVR in a [cluster mode](16-cluster.md), but this is for strict frame-level synchronization on multiple machines that are connected on a fast, local network to render on tiled displays.
