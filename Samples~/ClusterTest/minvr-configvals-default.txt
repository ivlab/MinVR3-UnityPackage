# MinVR3 ConfigVal File (Assets/minvr-configvals-default.txt)
# This file is parsed when VREngine starts up.
# 
# Notes: The typical use of this file is to define default settings for ConfigVals, where
# "default" means the value works well for multiple VRConfigs.  For example, a good size in
# meters for a VR menu might be the same for many VR HMDs, CAVEs, or Powerwalls so a default
# size could be defined here like `MENU_SIZE = 1.5`.  MENU_SIZE would not be redefined in any
# VRConfig-specific config files (e.g., settings-cave.minvr.txt) where 1.5 is a good size,
# but MENU_SIZE would be redefined in VRConfig-specific config files where the size should
# be different.  For example, the menu would need to be much smaller than 1.5 meters when
# running in Desktop or zSpace modes, so these config files could overwrite the MENU_SIZE
# setting by including a line like `MENU_SIZE = 0.25`.  In the menu's Start() function,
# Programmers would apply the setting to the menu by writing something like:
#    this.size = ConfigVal("MENU_SIZE", 1.5);
# Note, the second argument to the ConfigVal command is the default value to use if an
# entry for MENU_SIZE is not found.

MENU_SIZE = 1.5
